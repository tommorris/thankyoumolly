        Molly,
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope you are feeling better.

        You've taught us important things about the Web: about HTML, CSS,
        accessibility, browsers. It's hard to overestimate the number of us
        whose lives you have affected with your writing, your advocacy, your
        enthusiasm and your kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who has met you can't help but like you. This is just to say,
        we're thinking about you.

        You are one of the few people who treats everyone you meet, no matter
        how much of a noob they are when you first meet them, with love and
        kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You make the Web better by being here.

        I don't know you, but one of the first book I saw on CSS was "The ZEN of CSS" and I have to say it just made it look "possible" for me to learn it. Well, it was possible, I now have learnt it. Don't give up because everything is possible.

        Thank you,

        You make the Web kinder. You made me think about all the things. Like accessibility.
        I mean, accessibility is the most compassionate thing we can do as web developers. I don't know when a blind person will visit my website, but I imagine how happy they'll be.

        Dear Molly
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you, for everything. As a woman in the open web community, you
        are someone I look up to – because you have been so amazing, just doing
        your thing. Being who you are. Your passion for the things you care
        about, the unselfconscious way you present yourself, the community
        you've helped nurture and create simply by being one of the kindest and
        friendliest people in it... You've made a big difference. Both to the
        Web and to me as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know you've been having a rough time, and I'm sending love and
        thoughts of peace. I wish I could do more.  But even outside of that,
        it's nice to have the opportunity to say:  thank you for being
        wonderful.
      </p>
