        Molly,
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope you are feeling better.

        You've taught us important things about the Web: about HTML, CSS,
        accessibility, browsers. It's hard to overestimate the number of us
        whose lives you have affected with your writing, your advocacy, your
        enthusiasm and your kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who has met you can't help but like you. This is just to say,
        we're thinking about you.

        You are one of the few people who treats everyone you meet, no matter
        how much of a noob they are when you first meet them, with love and
        kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You make the Web better by being here.

        I don't know you, but one of the first book I saw on CSS was "The ZEN of CSS" and I have to say it just made it look "possible" for me to learn it. Well, it was possible, I now have learnt it. Don't give up because everything is possible.
      </p>

        Thank you,

        You make the Web kinder. You made me think about all the things. Like accessibility.
        I mean, accessibility is the most compassionate thing we can do as web developers. I don't know when a blind person will visit my website, but I imagine how happy they'll be.
